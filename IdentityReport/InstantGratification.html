		<h1> UCS PowerTool and Instant Gratification </h1>

Integrating software with infrastructure components can be an onerous and time-consuming effort.  It often involves late night searches for 
documentation and code examples, fueled by copious amounts of caffeine.   More often, client code must be refactored, recompiled and redeployed 
because of missing data or unexpected results from the targeted system.  In my experience, early integration and robust client 
libraries are critical in avoiding surprises and expediting the development/integration process.  Ideally, integrators could issue commands 
that target infrastructure in the same way that a Windows user issues commands in a DOS shell.  This ease of use is integration is achieved by 
the UCS PowerTool library.

<p>

System integrators and administrators can get "instant-gratification" by issuing query and configuration commands through the UCS PowerTool command-line.
These commands can be grouped in a transaction and can target one, or many UCS domains - even if the target domains are running different
versions of UCS software.  For more compicated operations, commands can be called from a PowerTool script.  
Alas, the purpose of this article is not to describe the virtues of UCS PowerTool, but, to get you to experience it for yourself.

Perhaps the best way to get started with PowerShell is by using it to perform common administrative task.   So, let's consider a common task 
and use PowerShell to accomplish it.   How about generating a html report of all the identities used in our UCS domains (wwns, uuids, ip addresses, iqns).  
We can do this with only a few simple commands!


<ul>
	<li> First, we need to connect to multiple UCS domains.  We just have to remember to set the "SupportMultipeDefaultUcs" flag. </li>
<pre>
Set-UcsPowerToolConfiguration -SupportMultiplDefaultUcs $true
Connect-Ucs 10.29.141.18
Connect-Ucs 10.29.141.21
Get-UcsPSSession
</pre>
	<li> We can query any of the identities based on their UCS class name.  We can format them to extract the fields we wish to view.</li>
<pre>
	Get-UcsMacPoolAddr | Format-Table  ucs,id,assigned,owner,assignedToDn
	Get-UcsUuidPoolAddr  | Format-Table ucs,id,assigned,owner,assignedToDn
	Get-UcsFcPoolAddr  | Format-Table ucs,id,assigned,owner,assignedToDn
	Get-UcsIpPoolAddr  | Format-Table ucs,id,assigned,owner,assignedToDn
        Get-UcsIqnPoolAddr  | Format-Table ucs,name,assigned,owner,assignedToDn

</pre>
	<li> The following commands can be used to identify duplicate identities.  The same approach could be used for each type of identity. </li>

	<pre>
	$lMacs Get-UcsMacPoolAddr | Format-Table  ucs,id,assigned,owner,assignedToDn
        $lMacs | Group-Object {$_.id} | Where-Object {$_.count -gt 1 } | select -ExpandProperty Group |  select Ucs,Id,assigned,assignedToDn | sort-object id
	</pre>

	<li> Now, we have all the information that we need from UCS.  Next, we can use PowerSell call these commands and output the results as a report.
	Here is a simple example of a IdentityReport PowerShell script that produced the following Report.
     </li>
</ul>

This is just a simple example that illustrates how easy it is to extract mult-domain UCS configuration information.
