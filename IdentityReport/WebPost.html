		<h1> UCS PowerTool and Instant Gratification </h1>
<p>
Integrating software with infrastructure components can be an onerous and time-consuming effort.  It often involves late night searches for 
documentation and code examples, fueled by copious amounts of caffeine.   More often, client code must be refactored, recompiled and redeployed 
because of missing data or unexpected results from the targeted system.  This integration pain can be eased (and surprises avoided) by 
integrating early and using robust client  libraries.  Ideally, integrators could issue commands that target infrastructure in the same way 
that a Windows user issues commands in a DOS shell.  This ease of integration with UCS can be realized by using the UCS PowerTool library.
</p>

<p>
With UCS PowerTool, integrators can get "instant-gratification" by issuing query and configuration cmdlets through the PowerTool command-line.
These commands can be grouped in a transaction and can target one, or many UCS domains - even if the target domains are running different
versions of UCS software.  For more compicated operations, commands can be called from a PowerShell script.  
Alas, the purpose of this article is not to describe the virtues of UCS PowerTool, but, to get you to experience it for yourself.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the best way to get started with PowerShell is by using it to perform common administrative task.   
The following example is one that I presented at Cisco Live 2013.  It illustrates the use of PowerTool 
to generate a multi-domain html report of all the UCS identities (wwns, uuids, ip addresses, iqns).  
We require only a hand-full of cmdlets to do this and we can check our results as we go progress.
</p>

<p>
First, we need to connect to multiple UCS domains.  We just have to remember to set the "SupportMultipeDefaultUcs" flag. 
</p>

<pre>
	Set-UcsPowerToolConfiguration -SupportMultiplDefaultUcs $true
	Connect-Ucs 10.29.141.18
	Connect-Ucs 10.29.141.21
	Get-UcsPSSession
</pre>


We can query any of the identities based on their UCS class name.  We can format them to extract the fields we wish to view.

<pre>
	Get-UcsMacPoolAddr | Format-Table  ucs,id,assigned,owner,assignedToDn
	Get-UcsUuidPoolAddr  | Format-Table ucs,id,assigned,owner,assignedToDn
	Get-UcsFcPoolAddr  | Format-Table ucs,id,assigned,owner,assignedToDn
	Get-UcsIpPoolAddr  | Format-Table ucs,id,assigned,owner,assignedToDn
        Get-UcsIqnPoolAddr  | Format-Table ucs,name,assigned,owner,assignedToDn
</pre>

The following cmdlets can be used to identify duplicate identities.  The same approach could be used for each type of identity. 

<pre>
	$lMacs Get-UcsMacPoolAddr | Format-Table  ucs,id,assigned,owner,assignedToDn
        $lMacs | Group-Object {$_.id} | Where-Object {$_.count -gt 1 } | select -ExpandProperty Group |  select Ucs,Id,assigned,assignedToDn | sort-object id
</pre>

<p>
Now, we have all the information that we need from UCS.  Next, we can use embed them in a PowerShell script and format the results
in a report.  Here is a simple example of a <a href="https://github.com/greygoose/PowerTool/tree/master/IdentityReport"> IdentityReport</a>
PowerShell script that produced the following Report.

<p>
Although this is a basic example. it illustrates the ease of extracting mult-domain UCS configuration information.  
A more involved example of harvesting identity information for multiple UCS domains can be found here:
