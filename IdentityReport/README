Identity Report

This is a simple script to demonstrate some simple UCS PowerTool Commands.  
It will produce an HTML document with all the identities for a list of UCS domains.

Note: The generated report references style-sheets and java script resources in the
resource directory.


Usage:

Get an identity report for the listed ucs domains:

	IdentityReport -ucsips <ucs-ip1,ucs-ip2> -report IdReport.html

Example:

To see report of identities on two ucs domains:

	ShowIdentity -ucsips 10.29.141.18,10.29.141.21 -report IdReport.html
