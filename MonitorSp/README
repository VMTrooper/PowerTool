MonitorSp

To get a usage message:
	MonitorSp 

A simple demo script to illustrate the UCS XML API and PowerTool libraries.
It is intended to monitor a service profile that is associated with physical 
hardware via a compute pool.  If a fatal fault occurs, it decomissions 
the physical blade/rack-server and re-associates the service profile with 
another server.  

The fail-over criteria is the existence of a "fatal" fault.
Fatal faults are defined provided by users in a csv file. 
 
For example: 

type,code,name
"cpu","F0180","fltProcessorUnitVoltageThresholdNonRecoverable"
"memory","F0184","fltMemoryUnitDegraded"
"memory","F0185","fltMemoryUnitInoperable"
"memory","F0537","fltMemoryBufferUnitThermalThresholdNonRecoverable"
"memory","F0191","fltMemoryArrayVoltageThresholdNonRecoverable"
"memory","F0188","fltMemoryUnitThermalThresholdNonRecoverable

You can simulate a fail-over by setting the "usrLbl" field of the physical
blade to "SIM FAILURE" if the script is run with the -sim option

Examples:

To monitor service profile Bill polling every 10 minutes:

	MonitorSp -ucsip 10.29.141.18 -poll 600 -spdn org-root/ls-Orcl -logfile=info.log -fault fault.csv

To monitor service profile Bill polling every 5 minutes and fail-over if the user
updates the physical nodes user label to "SIM FAILURE"
	MonitorSp -ucsip 10.29.141.18 -poll 300 -spdn org-root/ls-VmScale" -sim
