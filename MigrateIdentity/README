Migrate UCS Identity 

To get a usage message, run :

	MigrateUCS-Identity 


MigrateUCS-Identity will combine UCS identity pools from various sources and generate an xml configuration
that can be posted to UCS central.  The identity sources will typically be UCS systems but, can also be CSV files 
(perhaps created a previous run of this script). A number of files are created by the script - however, the
most important is the XML command file that can be posted to UCS central.  


Generated Files

Log file (for debuging only)                 : migrate.log
CSV file with merged ids                     : migrate.csv
XML file that contains UCS central commands: : migrate.xml
CSV id file for each ucs system              : <system-ip>-ids.csv (with -cvsperucs flag)


Supported Options:

-keepuuidprefix                                - the uuid prefix is cleared (set to all zeros) by default for 
                                                 uuid pools.  This option preserves the prefix.
-csvperucs 			                 - create a csv file for each ucs system (for archive purposes).
-overwrite                                     - over-write existing files if they exist
-logFile <log-filename>                        - set the logfilename (default is migrate.log)
-commandFile <command-filename>                - set the command-filename (default is migrate.xml)
-outIdFile <out-id-filename>  	         - set the csv filename for the merged identities
-inIdFiles <in-id-filename>[,<in-id-filename>] - list of csv files to merge
-ucsips <ucs-ip>[,<ucs-ip>]                    - list of ucs ip addresses


Typical Usage
 
Example 1: 

To merge the identities of two ucs systems, over-writing files (with same name) and
creating csv files describing ids each ucs system (for archival purposes):

MigrateUCS-Identity.ps1 -overwrite -ucs 10.29.141.18,10.29.141.21 -csvperucs 


Example 2: 
To merge the identities from two ucs systems and two csv files, over-writing files (with same name)

MigrateUCS-Identity.ps1 -overwrite -ucs 10.29.141.18,10.29.141.21 -idFiles 10.29.141.33-ids.csv,10.29.141.36-ids.csv  -csvperucs 

Details:

Where possible, the script attempts to combine the identities from various sources with-out any modification.  
However, this is not always possible due to name conflicts or over-lapping blocks.  Below, we list some scenarios
where the data must be massaged in order to have a valid configuration.

i) Uuid pools with the distinguished name but different prefixes will be renamed.   
   The new name will contain the  suffix "-RENAME".  A warning message is printed if this happens.

ii) IQN pools with the distinguished name but different prefixes will be renamed.   The new name will contain the  
    suffix "-RENAME".  A warning message is printed if this happens.
iii) Any over-lapping identity blocks in a pool will be combined to create a new compound block;

iv) Since the maximum UCS block size is 1000 identities, any blocks with > 1000 identities will be broken down 
    into multiple blocks.  

v) WWN pools with the same name but different purposes will be renamed.  WWN node and port pools will be renamed with
   suffix "-RENAME_NP".  WWN node pools will be renamed "-RENAME_NODE".  WWN port pools will not be renamed.

vi) When pools with different assignment order are merged, a warning message is printed;

vii) Ip pools can be merged, however, a warning message will be printed if blocks in the pool have different
     primary dns, secondary dns, subnet or default gateway.
